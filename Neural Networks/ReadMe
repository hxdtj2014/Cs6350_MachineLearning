For problem 2: (Neural_networks.py)
(a), (b), (c):  just change the file path at the beginning of the file, run the code directly, the results will be automaitcally generated and printed out. Also, if needed, remove the quote to check the plots.
(e)[Bonus](PNN_Xavier_tanh.py, PNN_he_relu.py): just change the file path and run the code directly, results will be automatically generated and printed out. Also, change the epoch to be 5 and 50 at line 121 for the files.

For problem 3 [Bonus] (Logistic_regression.py), just change the file path at the beginning of the file, remove the quote for each question, and run code directly, the results will be automaitcally generated and printed.
